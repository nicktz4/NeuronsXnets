# Repository Overview

This repository hosts datasets and accompanying documentation from two sets of experiments:

1. **Stimulus and Spontaneous** recordings
2. **Passive Learning** sessions

Both datasets capture neural activity under different experimental conditions and are intended to support analyses of brain dynamics, responses to stimuli, and learning-related processes.

## Dataset 1: Stimulus (1hr) followed by resting state (1hr)

This dataset contains recordings of neural activity during two contrasting conditions:

- **Stimulus-driven activity:** Neural responses recorded while external sensory stimuli were presented.
- **Spontaneous activity:** Recordings captured in the absence of external stimuli, reflecting the brainâ€™s intrinsic activity.

### Overview of the Experiment
- Animals were implanted with multi-electrode arrays.
- During stimulus sessions, repeated sensory stimuli were presented.
- During spontaneous sessions, no stimuli were delivered.
- The dataset allows comparisons between externally driven and internally generated activity patterns.

**Use cases:** Studying neural coding, spontaneous versus evoked dynamics, variability across trials, and state-dependent neural processing.

## Dataset 2: Passive Learning

This dataset contains recordings from experiments investigating how neural responses evolve during **passive exposure** to stimuli without explicit tasks or rewards.

### Overview of the Experiment
- Subjects were exposed to repeated sensory input without active engagement.
- Neural responses were tracked across multiple sessions to assess changes over time.
- The dataset highlights how experience and repeated exposure can shape neural activity, even in the absence of reinforcement or task demands.

**Use cases:** Analyzing neural plasticity, adaptation over repeated exposures, and dynamics of passive learning.
